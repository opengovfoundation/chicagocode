The State Decoded
=================

A free, open source PHP- and MySQL-based application to parse and display state laws. This project is currently in beta testing [as a Virginia implementation](http://vacode.org/).

#### Notes
This is the Virginia implementation, stripped down and normalized. Simply installing this would not yield useful results. That said, a few hours of work could well yield a useful, functioning website.

A Google API key must be entered in includes/page.inc.php for the Google JS API call.
